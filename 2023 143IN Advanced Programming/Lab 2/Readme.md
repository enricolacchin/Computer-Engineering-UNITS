# Lab 2

1. Design and implement a class that represents $X = \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R})$
  - with a proper `equals()`
  - with a proper `toString()`
  - with a proper constructor that takes 0+ values $\in \mathbb{R}$
  
2. Write an application that reads from stdin two comma-separated lists of real numbers, creates $x_1, x_2 \in X$, and outputs a text message saying if $x_1, x_2$ are the same or not
  - user gives two separated inputs
  - comma separates values within each input
